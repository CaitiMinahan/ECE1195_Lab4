# ECE1195_Lab4
Lab 4 project for Advanced Digital Design class

Implement a 32-bit CPU, based on MIPS32 instruction set architecture (ISA). 

Design the 32-bit MIPS CPU, per the description above. Your final top-level CPU should have
the following IO ports. 
Write multiple Tcl scripts implementing different programs. Your programs should at least try
each instruction once. The scripts should follow the example script given to instantiate the memory component. Your final CPU testbench top-level entity (the one that includes the memory) should be named
“cpu_tb” and it should only have two components, the CPU and the provided memory block.
Design an assembly program that would test your multiplication commands and write a Tcl script for it.
Write multiple C/C++ testbenches implementing different programs. Your programs should at least try each instruction once.
